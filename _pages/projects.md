## Academic/Professional Projects: 
<br>
<b>1. LifeBlood</b> <br> 
A GPS based blood donor finder android app which sorts out nearer blood donors across the map. In addition, a user rating system and profiling of donors are being implemented.
<br>
<b>2. AutoPilot-Web</b> <br> 
A web-based digital transformation of BTS (Base transceiver station) management. Its purpose is to optimize and automate the existing network management system. 
<br>
<b>3. AutoPilot-Mobile</b> <br> 
A mobile application (iOS and Android) for the digital transformation of BTS (Base transceiver station) management.
<br>
<b>4. LogBook</b> <br> 
A web-based application for personal task management including task manager, notes, attachments, reminders and synchronization.
<br>
<b>5. Offline-Search-Engine</b> <br> 
An Offline (file-folder) search engine for Linux and Windows operating systems.
