## Academic/Professional Projects: 
<br>

1. <b>[Image-to-Image Translation using Conditional GAN](http://galib19.github.io/projects/ImageToImage2021)</b> <br> The goal of this project is to generate colored images from
sketches using a generative model. Conditional GAN-based
architecture is incorporated to accomplish the goal. Basically, this project is motivated by the renowned paper -- [Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks (Isola et al.)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Isola_Image-To-Image_Translation_With_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). The architecture and guidelines suggested by the the paper is incorporated in to this project. [(Show Details...)](http://galib19.github.io/projects/ImageToImage2021) <br><br>

2. <b>[Analyzing co-authorship network: Centrality Measure, Link Prediction, and Community Detection](http://galib19.github.io/projects/AnalyzingCoauthorship2020)</b> <br> This project aims at analyzing a network of co-authorship relations between researchers (i.e., those in the top-300 highest hindex according to Google scholar and have collaborated at least once with each other). It includes network creation from XML data, data exploration, centrality measure using degree centrality, eigenvalue centrality, and local clustering coefficient. Also, it predicts missing links from the original network using Logistic Regression. Finally, it detects a set of connected components (communities) using a K-means clustering based community detection algorithm.

3. <b>[Heart Disease Prediction and Factors Analysis](https://github.com/galib19/Heart-Disease-Prediction-and-Factors-Analysis)</b> <br> This project aims at predicting heart disease effectively with consideration of performance measures and significant factors/attributes analysis. So, it addresses two aspects: how the factors influence heart disease prediction and how well we can predict heart disease. By doing so, heart disease can be analyzed and predicted more effectively.<br> Several machine learning techniques with various configurations are employed here for prediction and important factors analysis. UCI repository: Cleveland database is used here for evaluation. Finally, this study suggests an analysis of important factors and recommend machine learning techniques to effectively predict heart disease.

4. <b>[LifeBlood](https://github.com/galib19/LifeBlood)</b> <br> “LifeBlood” is an android app for simplifying blood donation system. It is an GPS based blood donor finder android app which sorts out nearer blood donors across the map. In addition, a user rating system and profiling of donors are being implemented.

5. <b>[AutoPilot-Web](https://github.com/galib19/AutoPilot-Web)</b> <br> A web-based digital transformation of BTS (Base transceiver station) management. Its purpose is to optimize and automate the existing network management system. . Its purpose is to optimize the existing network management system. BTS management issues impact revenue generating activities and increase operational costs. As networks expand in size and complexity, availability and performance can be negatively impacted. An optimized and automated network management is a key element to reduce cost and increase agility. Technology used in this project: ✓ Laravel Framework ✓ PHP & MySQL ✓ XAMPP ✓ SourceTree ✓ Postman. [(Github)](https://github.com/galib19/AutoPilot-Web) <br><br> 
6. <b>[AutoPilot-Mobile](https://github.com/galib19/AutoPilot-Android-App)</b> <br> A mobile application (iOS and Android) for the digital transformation of BTS (Base transceiver station) management. AutoPilot-Mobile} A mobile application (iOS and Android) for digital transformation of BTS (Base transceiver station) management. Technology used in this project: ✓ React Native ✓ React Redux ✓ Redux-Saga (middleware) ✓ Android Emulator ✓ Postman ✓ SourceTree. [(Github)](https://github.com/galib19/AutoPilot-Android-App) <br><br> 
7. <b>[LogBook](https://github.com/galib19/Logbook)</b> <br> ‘Logbook’ is a web based application which serves as a personal task management tool. This is a simple note taking application that allows you to create text notes, lists, and more. There is are two interfaces- admin interface and user interface. Users have to authenticate to the system to perform tasks. They can add, remove, update notes, lists, tasks, to-do-list, reminder. They can update their information in the account. There is a common introduction page for all the users. From there they can sign up and log in. A non-user can register to be a user. There is a search-bar to search specific note by using heading or tag words. [(Github)](https://github.com/galib19/Logbook) <br><br> 
8. <b>[Offline-Search-Engine](https://github.com/galib19/Offline-Search-Enginee)</b> <br> An Offline (file-folder) search engine for Linux and Windows operating systems. This project aims to build an optimizing time efficient offline search engine for Linux or Windows operating system respectively. We often face difficulties to use default operating system’s search engine. Like as, it takes too much time for searching. Sometimes we could not find our desired files. This tool mainly concentrates on overcoming that time-wasting process with a little loss of memory. [(Github)](https://github.com/galib19/Offline-Search-Enginee)<br>
