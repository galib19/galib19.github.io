## Research Projects: 
<br>
1. <b>[Pre-birth Factors in the Early Assessment of Child Mortality using Machine Learning Techniques](http://galib19.github.io/projects/ChildMortality2019)</b><br> <br>
    Team: <b>Asadullah Hill Galib</b>, Nadia Nahar, and B M Mainul Hossain.
    <br><br>
    This research project analyzes pre-birth factors, such as birth history, maternal history, reproduction history, socio-economic condition, etc. for the early classification of child mortality. Manuscript in Preparation. [(Show Details...)](http://galib19.github.io/projects/ChildMortality2019)

## Academic/Professional Projects: 
<br>
1. <b>[Analyzing co-authorship network: Centrality Measure, Link Prediction, and Community Detection](https://github.com/galib19/Analyzing-co-authorship-network-centrality-measure-link-prediction-community-detection)</b> <br> This project aims at analyzing a network of co-authorship relations between researchers (i.e., those in the top-300 highest hindex according to Google scholar and have collaborated at least once with each other). It includes network creation from XML data, data exploration, centrality measure using degree centrality, eigenvalue centrality, and local clustering coefficient. Also, it predicts missing links from the original network using Logistic Regression. Finally, it detects a set of connected components (communities) using a K-means clustering based community detection algorithm.

1. <b>[Heart Disease Prediction and Factors Analysis](https://github.com/galib19/Heart-Disease-Prediction-and-Factors-Analysis)</b> <br> This project aims at predicting heart disease effectively with consideration of performance measures and significant factors/attributes analysis. So, it addresses two aspects: how the factors influence heart disease prediction and how well we can predict heart disease. By doing so, heart disease can be analyzed and predicted more effectively.<br> Several machine learning techniques with various configurations are employed here for prediction and important factors analysis. UCI repository: Cleveland database is used here for evaluation. Finally, this study suggests an analysis of important factors and recommend machine learning techniques to effectively predict heart disease.<br><br> 
1. <b>[LifeBlood](https://github.com/galib19/LifeBlood)</b> <br> A GPS based blood donor finder android app which sorts out nearer blood donors across the map. In addition, a user rating system and profiling of donors are being implemented.<br><br> 
1. <b>[AutoPilot-Web](https://github.com/galib19/AutoPilot-Web)</b> <br> A web-based digital transformation of BTS (Base transceiver station) management. Its purpose is to optimize and automate the existing network management system. <br><br> 
1. <b>[AutoPilot-Mobile](https://github.com/galib19/AutoPilot-Android-App)</b> <br> A mobile application (iOS and Android) for the digital transformation of BTS (Base transceiver station) management.<br><br> 
1. <b>[LogBook](https://github.com/galib19/Logbook)</b> <br> A web-based application for personal task management including task manager, notes, attachments, reminders and synchronization.<br><br> 
1. <b>[Offline-Search-Engine](https://github.com/galib19/Offline-Search-Enginee)</b> <br> An Offline (file-folder) search engine for Linux and Windows operating systems.<br>
