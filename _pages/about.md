I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University from Fall 2020. My works revolves around deep learning, Spatio-temporal analysis, Extreme Value Theory (EVT), tipping points in non-linear dynamics. Currently, I am working on developing novel deep learning algorithms for Spatio-temporal and sequential data with the incorporation of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and tipping points analysis for climate change. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in [DMiner Lab @ MSU](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~ptan/dminer/) under the supervision of [Dr. Pang-Ning Tan](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~ptan/). Previously, I have completed my Master of Science (MSc.) and Bachelor of Science (BSc.) in Software Engineering from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Aside from academics, I enjoy reading, traveling, gaming, and other exciting pursuits.
