As a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science specializing in Artificial Intelligence and its application, with a solid foundation in Software Engineering and a diverse research background that includes multi-disciplinary collaborative experience, I am confident that my skills and expertise can greatly benefit society. 

Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University from Fall 2020. My work revolves around deep learning, time series and spatio-temporal analysis, Extreme Value Theory (EVT), and self-supervised learning. Specifically, I am working on developing novel deep learning algorithms for Spatio-temporal and sequential data with the incorporation of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and self-supervised learning. I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in [DMiner Lab @ MSU](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~ptan/dminer/) under the supervision of [Dr. Pang-Ning Tan](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~ptan/). Previously, I have completed my Master of Science (MSc.) and Bachelor of Science (BSc.) in Software Engineering from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Beyond academia, I enjoy reading, traveling, gaming, and other exciting pursuits.
