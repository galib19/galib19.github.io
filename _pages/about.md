I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Michigan State University from Fall 2020. Currently, I'm looking for graduate research assistantship (GRA) opportunities.

I have completed my Master of Science (MS) and Bachelor of Science (BS)in Software Engineering from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. 

In the course of my journey, I have gone through several rises and falls in both academic and personal aspects. Today I become a confident person to be a researcher through all the ups and downs and associated transformations. I am profoundly grateful and thankful to the Almighty, my parents, my family members, my friends, my fellow-mates, my teachers, who support me and believe in me.
