[PhD Summary]
</span>](https://galib19.github.io/education/phd) 

As a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science specializing in Machine Learning, I offer a strong background in Software Engineering
coupled with a proven track record of multi-disciplinary research collaboration. I am committed to advancing knowledge through
innovations in AI. My experience and academic degrees present a unique blend of proficiency in deep learning, machine learning, software engineering, and statistics. 

My research involves developing novel deep learning frameworks that can effectively model extreme events in time series and spatio-temporal data with the incorporation of Extreme Value Theory (EVT), self-supervised learning, representation learning, and diffusion-based generative modeling. Specifically, my research focus is on both predictive and generative modeling to overcome the challenges associated with extreme value analysis in time series. Working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in the [DMiner Lab @ MSU](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~ptan/dminer/) under the supervision of [Dr. Pang-Ning Tan](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~ptan/), I am actively engaged in pushing the boundaries of knowledge in my field.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Masters and Bachelors in Software Engineering from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Beyond the academic realm, I enjoy reading, traveling, gaming, and other exciting pursuits.
