I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Michigan State University from Fall 2020. Currently, I'm working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in [DMiner Lab @ MSU](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~ptan/dminer/) under the supervision of [Dr. Pang-Ning Tan](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~ptan/). My research interests lie in deep learning, Spatio-temporal analysis, Extreme Value Theory (EVT), tipping points in non-linear dynamics. Specifically, I am working on developing a novel deep learning algorithm for Spatio-temporal and sequential data with the incorporation of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and tipping points analysis in non-linear dynamics.  

Previously, I have completed my Master of Science (MSc.) and Bachelor of Science (BSc.) in Software Engineering from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. 

In the course of my journey, I have gone through several rises and falls in both academic and personal aspects. Today I become a confident person to be a researcher through all the ups and downs and associated transformations. I am profoundly grateful and thankful to the Almighty, my parents, my family members, my friends, my fellow-mates, my teachers, my advisors, who support me and believe in me.
