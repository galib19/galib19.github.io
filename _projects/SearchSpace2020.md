## Abstract 

Detecting code smell in large-scale projects is a
critical aspect of software maintenance. Typical code smell
detection approaches search code smell in all source files, and
this process continues in multiple phases of the development lifecycle. That process may computationally complex for real-life
large-scale projects due to the vast size of the search space. In this
study, a simple search space reduction approach is proposed for
code smell detection based on a novel software evolution metric of
change history information. The proposed approach is evaluated
on 11 popular and large-scale projects from GitHub using code
smells dataset of four code smells - Blob, Feature Envy, Divergent
Change, Parallel Inheritance. Primarily, these four code smells
are selected to explore the applicability of the proposed search
space reduction approach. The results have shown that the
proposed metric significantly reduces the search space while
detecting a sound percentage of the actual code smell. It is
also analyzed that this approach performs considerably better
in detecting Blob, Feature Envy, and Divergent Change, while
depicting relatively poor performance for Parallel Inheritance.
In the future, other common code smells and more large-scale
projects will be analyzed using this approach.
