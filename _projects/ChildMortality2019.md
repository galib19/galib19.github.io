## Abstract 

Analysis of child mortality is crucial as it pertains to the policy and programs of a
country. The early assessment of patterns and trends in causes of child mortality
help decision-makers assess needs, prioritize interventions, and monitor progress.
Post-birth factors of the child, such as real-time clinical data, health data of the
child, etc. are frequently used in child mortality study. However, in the early
assessment of child mortality, pre-birth factors would be more practical and
beneficial than the post-birth factors. This study aims at incorporating pre-birth
factors, such as birth history, maternal history, reproduction history, socioeconomic condition, etc. for classifying child mortality. To assess the relative
importance of the features, Information Gain (IG) attribute evaluator is employed.
For classifying child mortality, four machine learning algorithms are evaluated.
Results show that the proposed approach achieved an AUC score of 0.947 in
classifying child mortality which outperformed the clinical standards. In terms of
accuracy, precision, recall, and f-1 score, the results are also notable and uniform.
In developing countries like Bangladesh, the early assessment of child mortality
using pre-birth factors would be effective and feasible as it avoids the uncertainty
of the post-birth factors.
