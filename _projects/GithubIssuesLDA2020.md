## Abstract 

Topic modeling is the process of extracting keywords
from documents to characterize and distinguish them from other
documents. It is a process applied to summarize, compare and
analyze large corpus of text. In the software engineering domain,
it has been applied to mine repositories and extract valuable
insight into the important properties and aspects of the project
and its developers. One such important aspect of current project
management efforts is the prediction of issue lifetime. This study
conducts topic modeling on GitHub issues to observe patterns
in the extracted topics and their performance as a feature
for predicting the lifetime of issues. It is observed that issues
from a large collection of projects can yield distinguishable and
comprehensible topics. In terms of predictive performance, the
prediction model with topic modeling performs better than the
previous approach, with a high increase in precision and f1-
measure. Evaluating these findings helps establish topic modeling
as a viable feature in issue-based software development processes.
