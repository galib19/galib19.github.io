## Abstract 

Audio communication has become very much
widely prevalent in this modern era. With the increase of its
availability and usability, the privacy concern has become an
important issue to be addressed. The participants of an audio
conversation like to secure their privacy without any hindrance
in the regular activities. Especially, such type of technology is
expected in real time. In the past, some notable solution has
been provided to resolve privacy-related issues, however, that
solution was not that much user-friendly. In this paper, an
approach has been proposed to provide the participants of an
audio communication full audio privacy in real time. It will
completely hide the vocal identity without compromising any
information of the audio stream. This approach does not involve
any extra hardware mechanism or data analysis to provide
the service. In either way, it is very much user-friendly and
inexpensive solution for the users to preserve their security in
audio conversation.
