## Abstract 

Nowadays Android is the world's most popular mobile operating system. Its
pervasiveness also provokes the enormous growth of Android malware. Using machine
learning methods to detect Android malware, researchers have focused on static analysis
and dynamic analysis for most. But, different evasion techniques by shrewd malware
authors made those techniques inadequate and ineffective. Therefore, recent researchers
have turned their attention to the discovery of an effective strategy to combat. Hybrid
analysis which is a fusion of static analysis and dynamic analysis would be a good
candidate for that as it prevails over the individual shortcomings of static and dynamic
analysis with the cost of complexity. Hybrid analysis has many opportunities as well as
challenges. This research is intended to offer a detailed and systematic review of hybrid
analysis using machine learning techniques for malware detection in Android. It
encompasses leading hybrid analysis research: their contributions, strengths, and
weaknesses. This work also discusses the challenges, opportunities, and future directions
of hybrid analysis in detecting Android malware.
