## Abstract 

Android API Calls are an important factor in
differentiating malware from benign applications. Due to the
increasing number of API Calls and considering computational
complexity, the number of API calls in Android malware detection
should be assessed and reduced without affecting detection
performance. This study tries to figure out a feature reduction
approach for identifying significant API Calls in Android malware
detection. It incrementally analyzes various feature selection
techniques to find out the minimal feature set and the most suitable
technique. Also, it incorporated a correlation-based feature
elimination strategy for further reduction of API Calls.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the Recursive
Feature Elimination with Random Forest Classifier causes the
minimal number of API Calls. Evaluation results indicate that the
reduced set of significant API Calls (SigAPI) will perform
relatively close to the full set of features in terms of accuracy,
accuracy, recall, f-1 performance, AUC, and execution time. It also
compares the performance with the existing malware detection
works and the SigAPI outperforms most of the work regarding
malware detection rate. Furthermore, it reports the top significant
API Calls in malware detection. Finally, this work suggests that
reduced features set of significant API Calls would be useful in
classifying Android malware effectively.
